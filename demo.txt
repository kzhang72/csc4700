What is your favorite movie?

Not really one movie, but the Lord of the Rings trilogy wins for visuals and soundtrack.

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?

Hangzhou, China.  My parents' hometown.  It's a tourist city in China, so the local government
actually cares about the environment, and the place has got such a laid back feel to it.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?

There's a woman in one of my favorite books who's got a pretty broken power.  She calls it
path to victory.  If she poses it a question about how to get something done, it tells her
exactly how many steps she needs to take to get it done and what they are.  In universe, it's
classified as a thinker power, but it's one of the few that can properly be leveraged in combat.
The universe has a couple of kaiju type things which are immune to the effect, and given that the
setting is rather grimdark and she received her power whilst in her teens, I think she has some
dependency on it, but my version just wouldn't have anything that it couldn't effect and would
not mess with my head.

I think Tim is talking about powers from the same universe, if you're interested,
